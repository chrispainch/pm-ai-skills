# Hotbread Studio

Hotbread Studio is where Christian Painchaud develops agentic skills for his own use.

This repository contains a small set of skill collections organized around practical workflows rather than generic prompts. Each collection lives in its own project folder and exposes skills through `skills/`.

## Current Projects

### `job-search-skills`

This collection is focused on structured job-search operations: turning career history into reusable source data, tailoring resumes to specific roles, and tracking application progress.

- `career-source-intake`: maps existing artifacts such as resumes, CSVs, notes, or exports into a canonical `career-source.json` source of truth.
- `career-source-interview`: enriches or reconstructs career records from memory through guided questioning before saving back to the canonical file.
- `custom-resume`: creates a tailored resume for a specific job posting using evidence from the canonical career source and saves artifacts into an application workspace.
- `job-pipeline-tracking`: updates application workspace metadata after applying, interviewing, hearing back, or closing out a process.

At a high level, this project forms a workflow:
`career source -> tailored application artifacts -> pipeline tracking`.

### `software-pm-skills`

This collection is aimed at software product and UX work. The skills are arranged around a typical progression from problem definition to solution shaping, interface exploration, and launch planning.

- `problem-framing`: defines the user need, current gap, pain, desired user outcome, and expected organizational value before solution design starts.
- `breadboarding`: maps current-state or target-state workflows into flowchart-ready tables that show screens, affordances, transitions, and technical constraints.
- `solution-shaping`: defines solution boundaries, components, scope, risks, and success criteria without dropping into implementation detail too early.
- `ascii-ui-exploration`: explores screen structure and interaction hierarchy with ASCII concepts once the solution is already shaped.
- `product-launching`: prepares rollout briefs, documentation needs, phased launch plans, and success measurement for a shaped solution.

At a high level, this project forms a workflow:
`frame the problem -> map the flow -> shape the solution -> explore the UI -> prepare the launch`.

### `wardley-strategy-skills`

This collection is focused on structured strategy work using Wardley Maps. It helps turn vague strategic discussion into explicit user needs, mapped value chains, evolutionary positioning, doctrine gaps, climatic forces, inertia, and context-specific plays.

- `wardley-strategy`: structures strategy analysis around user needs, value chains, evolution, doctrine, climatic patterns, and strategic plays rather than generic planning language.

At a high level, this project forms a workflow:
`user needs -> value chain -> evolution -> patterns and inertia -> strategic plays`.

## Structure

Current top-level folders:

- `job-search-skills/`
- `software-pm-skills/`
- `wardley-strategy-skills/`

Within each project, skills live under:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Each collection also includes a high-level `README.md` plus supporting templates and references inside its skill folders.

## Summary

The repository currently contains three active agentic skill projects:

1. A job-search system centered on canonical career data, tailored application artifacts, and pipeline tracking.
2. A software/PM system centered on product thinking, UX flow mapping, solution definition, interface exploration, and launch preparation.
3. A Wardley strategy system centered on user needs, value-chain mapping, evolutionary analysis, and strategic gameplay.
