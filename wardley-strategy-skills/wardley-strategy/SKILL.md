# Wardley Strategy

Use Wardley Maps as a strategy method, not as decoration. Anchor on user needs, map the landscape, identify climatic forces and inertia, then propose context-specific plays.

Treat the visual Wardley map as a derived view for humans. Treat the primary working artifact as a structured map that another agent can inspect, update, diff, and render.

## Workflow

1. Define the scope and link the relevant product direction when it exists.
2. Identify the relevant users and their needs.
3. Build a structured map of components and relationships needed to meet those needs.
4. Position components by evolution: `genesis`, `custom built`, `product`, `commodity / utility`.
5. Surface assumptions, missing components, duplication, and bias.
6. Apply climatic patterns and doctrine.
7. Assess whether the landscape reaffirms, refines, or challenges the direction's desired future, strategic outcomes, and boundaries.
8. Propose plays, risks, and open uncertainties.
9. Render the structured map into tables, prose, or a visual map only if helpful.

## Operating Rules

- Start with user needs, not business slogans.
- Prefer a structured artifact over a diagram as the source of truth.
- Treat the map as a communication artifact for challenge and learning.
- Separate universal doctrine from context-specific gameplay.
- Avoid deterministic claims. Mapping improves situational awareness; it does not guarantee the right move.
- Challenge whether a component is truly novel or merely marketed as such.
- Watch for inertia caused by past success, sunk cost, org design, or existing business models.
- Keep observations about the landscape separate from choices about what to do.

## Outputs

Produce only what the task needs. Common outputs:

- a canonical structured map in YAML
- a markdown table rendering of that map
- a draft Wardley map in text or visual form
- a critique of an existing strategy through the Wardley lens
- a list of climatic patterns affecting the landscape
- doctrine gaps, duplication, and inertia to address
- context-specific strategic plays with tradeoffs

When a product direction exists, include a direction assessment with evidence that supports and challenges it, the assessment (`reaffirm`, `refine`, or `challenge`), and the recommended action. A map may challenge direction; do not force its plays to justify the existing intent.

Follow the [Product Artifact Contract](../../references/product-artifact-contract.md). Write the canonical structured map to `product/strategy/wardley/<domain-id>/map.yaml`; write a derived human review only when useful to `product/strategy/wardley/<domain-id>/review.md`.

## Preferred Artifact

Default to the structured schema in [references/structured-map-schema.md](./references/structured-map-schema.md).

Use it as the canonical representation because it:

- makes dependencies explicit
- separates users, components, relationships, patterns, and plays
- supports incremental updates and diffs
- can be rendered into tables or a visual map later

## Rendering Order

Prefer outputs in this order unless the user asks otherwise:

1. `structured YAML`
2. `markdown tables`
3. `visual Wardley map`

## Quick Text Format

When the task is small, use a compact textual structure instead of the full schema:

```text
Users and needs
- User: ...
- Needs: ...

Value chain
- Visible capability -> depends on ...
- Supporting capability -> depends on ...

Evolution
- Component: genesis | custom built | product | commodity

Signals
- Inertia:
- Climatic patterns:
- Doctrine gaps:

Strategic plays
- Play:
- Why here over there:
- Risks:
```
